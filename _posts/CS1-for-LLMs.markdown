Large language models (LLMs) are being used increasingly in computer science in general, and classrooms in particular. Plugins such as Github Copilot leverage LLMs and provide code suggestions in real time, and it is unclear how this impacts students' learning of fundamental computing principles. Our objective is to compare student outcomes in an LLM-augmented introductory computer science class as compared with a traditional computer science class, specifically examining differential outcomes across demographic backgrounds. To study this, I am working with Profs. Leo Porter (UCSD) and Daniel Zingaro (U of T) to develop an introductory CS class that includes instruction on the use of Copilot to help create effective code, including guidance with the basics of prompt engineering and querying LLMs to understand existing code. Throughout the course, we have been collecting data from surveys and assessments such as homeworks and exams. Our work will suggest future directions for more rigorous studies in the effects of LLMs on learning introductory CS, which may have widespread implications in the efficacy of equitably teaching the next generation of individuals who program.
